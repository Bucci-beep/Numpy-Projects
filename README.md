## **Projects Overview**

### **1. 1D Array Creation**
- **Description**: Created a 1D array with numbers ranging from 1 to 15 using `np.arange()`.
- **Key Skills**: Array generation, understanding of NumPy's range function.

### **2. Reshaping Arrays**
- **Description**: Reshaped a 1D array into various 2D arrays:
  - A 3x5 matrix.
  - A 4x5 matrix using `np.arange()`.
- **Key Skills**: Reshaping arrays with `.reshape()`, understanding dimensionality.

### **3. Randomized Arrays**
- **Description**:
  - Created a 1D array with 12 random integers between 1 and 100.
  - Shuffled a 1D array randomly using `np.random.permutation()`.
- **Key Skills**: Random number generation, shuffling arrays, understanding random seed usage.

### **4. Zero and Identity Matrices**
- **Description**:
  - Generated a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns filled with zeros using `np.zeros()`.
  - Created identity matrices using `np.eye()`.
- **Key Skills**: Generating zero-filled and identity matrices.

### **5. Coin Flip Simulation**
- **Description**: Simulated a coin flip experiment:
  - Generated random outcomes for multiple trials.
  - Calculated probabilities of Heads and Tails.
- **Key Skills**: Random binary outcome generation, probability calculation.
